## TODO

- [ ] update building process for cross-platform building...
    - [ ] add workflow with target arch and target architecture for project.

- [ ] fix config file parsing from cache (defines get lost on the way)

### THINGS TO THINK ABOUT:

- includes based on OS. (and architecture)
- rebuild command
    - `build --interactive` (hot rebuilding when proj files change)
- better way of handling packages (aka libs)

```
